Mathew Arogbo – Express Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.  
I designed it to showcase my networking labs, cybersecurity projects, and the technical skills I’ve developed at Ontario Tech University.  

It’s fully responsive, clean, and deployed online using Render.
