Mathew Arogbo – Express Portfolio

Welcome to my Express portfolio site! My name is Mathew Arogbo, and I’m a Networking & IT Security student at Ontario Tech University. This project is a personal website I created to highlight the networking labs I have finished and the cybersecurity abilities I have developed over my academic career.  It shows my progress in integrating web development into my subject of study in addition to showcasing my technical projects and laboratories. 
The site uses Node.js, Express.js, and EJS for server-side rendering. It is styled with a custom dark theme built using Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome, and CSS3.
Each page (Home, About, Projects, Contact) is dynamically rendered using modular Express routes, and the whole application is deployed on Render.
