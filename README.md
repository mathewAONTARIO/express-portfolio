Mathew Arogbo – Express Portfolio

Welcome to my Express portfolio site! My name is Mathew Arogbo, and I’m a Networking & IT Security student at Ontario Tech University. This project is a personal website I created to highlight the networking labs I've finished and the cybersecurity abilities I have developed over my academic career.  It shows my progress in integrating web development into my subject of study in addition to showcasing my technical projects and laboratories. 
This website was constructed using EJS templating for the frontend views and Node.js and Express.js for the backend.  The design has a unique dark theme created using CSS and is completely mobile-friendly.  To keep the code structured and manageable, I used modular Express routes for each of the app's sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact).  You may readily view the application online and watch everything in action because it is deployed on Render.
